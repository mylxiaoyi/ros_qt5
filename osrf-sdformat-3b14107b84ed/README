sdformat - Simulation Description Format (SDF) parser
-----------------------------------------------------

SDF is an XML file format that describes environments, objects, and robots
in a manner suitable for robotic applications. SDF is capable of representing
and describing different physic engines, lighting properties, terrain, static
or dynamic objects, and articulated robots with various sensors, and acutators.
The format of SDF is also described by XML, which facilitates updates and
allows conversion from previous versions. A parser is also contained within
this package that reads SDF files and returns a C++ interface.

Installation
------------
Standard installation can be performed in UNIX systems using the following 
steps:

 - mkdir build/
 - cd build/
 - cmake ..
 - sudo make install

sdformat supported cmake parameters at configuring time:
 - USE_EXTERNAL_URDF (bool) [default False]
   Do not use the internal copy of urdfdom and use the one installed in the
   system instead. Recommended if you have a working installation of urdfdom.
 - USE_UPSTREAM_CFLAGS (bool) [default True]
   Use the sdformat team compilation flags instead of the common set defined
   by cmake.
               
Uninstallation 
--------------
To uninstall the software installed with the previous steps:
